# hierarchiesProject

This is the first project I created when learning about OOP principles. In this game, the user is asked to choose from a list of characters,
who have varying abilities based on whether they are a robot or human, as well as individual attacks. They fight against a monster in this
text based game and are given varying attributes such as armor or extra health based on the type of character they choose.
